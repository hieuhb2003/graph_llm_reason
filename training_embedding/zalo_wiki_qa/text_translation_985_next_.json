Phosphate groups, starting from the group closest to the ribose group, are called alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), and gamma (\u03b3) phosphates, respectively. ATP is well soluble in water and fairly stable in solutions with a pH of 6.8 to 7.4, but is rapidly hydrolyzed at too high or too low a pH. Therefore, ATP is best stored as an anhydrous salt. The ATP molecule is unstable in unbuffered water and is hydrolyzed into ADP and phosphates. The reason is that the bonds between the remaining phosphate elements in ATP are weaker than the hydrogen bonds between ADP and water. So if ATP and ADP are in chemical equilibrium in water, almost all of the ATP will gradually turn into ADP. A chemical system that is far from equilibrium contains Gibbs free energy, and is capable of generating work. Living cells keep the ratio of ATP to ADP at 1010 times the equilibrium level, with an ATP concentration a thousand times higher than ADP concentration. At such a far level of equilibrium, hydrolyzed ATP releases large amounts of energy. ATP is often called a \"high-energy molecule\". However, this name is easily misleading. As all chemical reactions have reached equilibrium, a mixture of ATP and ADP that has reached a stable equilibrium in water will not result in further net hydrolysis of ATP. More precisely, ATP and water are like a mixture of reactive substances such as gasoline and oxygen: both must be present to release energy.", "Gallium nitride is an inorganic chemical compound, as well as an energy semiconductor.

The study found that large animals such as \u201cTyrannosaurus\" released stored energy long before they reached their theoretical maximum speed, resulting in a parabolic-like relationship between size and speed.

The species was first described scientifically by Laurenti in 1768.", "This snake lives in dense forests or open forests and is the only African cobra to live in high forests. It is well adapted to many environments. The habitat of this snake depends largely on where it originates in Africa. The forest cobra originates in southern Africa, usually found in savanna or grassland, but can also be found in rubble. It is mainly distributed along tropical and subtropical rainforests of West Africa and Central Africa. It also lives in mangrove forests of western Africa. The banded form of the forest cobra in West Africa is steppe, grassland (but often along streams) and areas with vegetation, especially riparian forests, up to 14 degrees north latitude. The preferred habitat is lowland forests, moist savanna where the snake prefers coastal thickets. The snake seems to be very adaptable, easily moving to drier areas if possible. In western Kenya, the forest cobra is found in widespread grassland areas. Populations of forest cobras in Uganda are almost always found near water sources. The brown morphology occurs coastal and high forests relative to molasses, open forests, shrubs, grassland areas (located in Nyanga, Zimbabwe). Due to its hiding habits, preferring to live in holes, the snake often exists in densely populated areas, common in and around many Central African towns, even long after most vegetation has disappeared. It also occurs on fruit plantations where it inhabits high trees.

Moreover, the king cobra has a narrower and longer neck gill. A very obvious method of identification, clearly visible on the head, is the presence of a pair of large scales called occipital bones, located on the back of the top of the head. This is the arrangement of nine posterior flattened bones, characteristic of the family Water snakes and family Tiger snakes, and unique to the king cobra.

When raising its body, the king cobra can still move quickly forward to attack even at a distance and the opponent may misjudge the safety range. The king cobra is capable of biting multiple times in a single attack, but the adult snake knows how to bite and hold on. That's how the snake defends itself when living in less populated forests and dense rainforests.
